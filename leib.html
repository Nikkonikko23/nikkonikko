<figure style="color:rgb(85, 138, 74);background-color:rgba(24, 16, 35, 0.623); font-size: 25px;" >"A Transient who came from the world of Tir na Nog who is also an Alder tree spirit. He is a graduate student researcher at a medical school who tends to speak of himself as an old man, as well as the resident assistant of the dorm for Therian Transients in Taito Ward and lead scientist at the research lab. His Role and Rule allow him to transfer any injury or damage from one being to another, giving him control over who lives or perishes. However, he considers the price for using this power to be too high, and thus avoids doing anything proactively except in the direst of circumstances. Because of this, other researchers have labeled him a sloth, and those younger than him usually despise him for pushing vast amounts of work onto them on account of their age. Leib can often be seen complaining about how difficult it can be to keep up with all the new slang."</figure>
